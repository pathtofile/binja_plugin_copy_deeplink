Example deeplink:\n```\nbinaryninja:///path/to/binary.bndb?expr=0x40369e\n```\n\nThe link can then be saved into an external Wiki, notebook, etc. Binary Ninja automatically installs a link handler at install time, so you just need to 'open' the link in a browser or from the commandline\nand it will open the right database as the correct location.",
